Promise Sequence Module.

Terse and simple promise sequences for thouse who don't want to reinvent the wheel like i did :rocket: :whale: :boom:.

## Install

```
npm i proq
npm i --save proq // to put it into your package.json
```

## Usage

```js
import proq from 'proq';

function magic1(params) {
  // make some magic here ...
  return new Promise(resolve => resolve(/* some result of our magic above */));
}

/* params is result of magic from magic1 */
function magic2(params) {
  // more magic here ...
  return new Promise(resolve => resolve(/* some result of our magic2 */));
}

proq([magic1, magic2], { unicorns: 10 } /* initial params */)
  .then(resultOfAllMagic => console.log(resultOfAllMagic));

```

Functions ```magic1``` and ```magic2``` will be called sequentially and result of each one will be passed to next one.
